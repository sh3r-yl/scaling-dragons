Just a little Dungeons &amp; Dragons class overview

## Brief Introduction

Just some brief backstory, I have never played Dungeons & Dragons. Also, I come from a designer background. I would say I'm proficient in HTML/CSS, not so much in JS and this has probably got to be the most amount of JS I have written in my life so far. Also, I had to learn about AJAX and REST API from scratch and I must say, it is pretty challenging.

### Prerequisites

* On page refresh randomly show 1 of the many D&D classes
* Display all other attributes related to the current class on the page
* Try your best to design the best layout for this challenge.

**Bonus:**
* Instead of loading a class on page refresh, display all available classes in a gallery page, users can click on which class they are interested in.
* Have your project hosted on a cloud service (this makes it easier for us to mark).

### Installing

You can view it [here](http://sh3r-yl.com/staging/scaling-dragons) but if you want to download the package, all you need to do is:


```
1. Extract the files
2. Double click on index.html
```
